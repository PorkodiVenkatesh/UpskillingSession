### Problems to be solved

1. Given a list of integers, find out all the even numbers exist in the list
2. Given a list of integers, find out all the numbers with whose sum of the digits is 9
```
input : [ 9, 34, 18, 56, 54 , 81]
ouput:  9 , 18, 54, 81
```
3. Given a list remove the duplicate elements in a given integers list in java
4. Given a list of integers, find out all the numbers start with 1
5. Given a list of integers, sort all the values present in it also find the maximum/minimun value element present in it
6. Given a list of integers, sort all the values present in it in descending order
7. Count Characters in the String 
```
Input: "Java is awesome"

Output:
J -> 1
a -> 3
v -> 1
i ->1 
s -> 2
w -> 1
e -> 2
o -> 1
```
8. Replace A with @ and reverse the string 

```
Input:  apple

output: elpp@

Expln -> apple -> @pple -> elpp@
```

9. Print unique numbers in the list/array

```
Input:  1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 1, 4

Output: 3  (becoz 3 occurred only one time)

Input: 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 3

Output: 1 2  (becoz 1 and 2 occurred only one time)
```

10. Caps Vowels (make vowels to the captails letter)

```
Input: porkodi
Output: pOrkOdi
```
 
11. Find first repeated char in a string 

```
"Java is awesome"

J -> 1
a -> 3

output: a

"Im from chennai"

output : i
```

12. find first non repeated char in a string

```
"Java is awesome"

output: J

"Im from chennai"

output : f
```

13. Reverse the last half

```
Input: Apple -> length = 5  -> odd -> last half = ple  -> reverse = elp

output: Apelp

Input: Bank -> length = 4 -> even -> last half = nk -> reverse = kn

output: Bakn
```

14. Take a string and print characters in numbers according to alphabet order like example abc=123 and then sum of it.

```
input : ace 
output: 9 
explm = a is 1, c is 3, e is 5, so sum = 1+ 3+ 5 = 9

i/p: vijay
o/p:  67
```

15. Remove the character from string if the character next to that is same and then again perform same operation on the resultant string until same strings are together

```
Input: google
output: le

expln: google -> ggle -> le

Input: addccae
output: e
expln: addccae -> accae -> aae -> e
```
